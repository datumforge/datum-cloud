# Datum Cloud

Building a SaaS offering on top of [Datum](https://github.com/datumforge/datum)

## Datum Cloud Server

### Getting Started

Starting the server, you can use the cli to bring up the local server. This will create a token to authenticate to the datum-api and startup the server:

```bash
task run-dev
```

You can then use the cli to do things like, create a new workspace:

```bash
task cli:workspace:create
```

## Datum Cloud CLI

### Installation

```bash
brew install datumforge/tap/datum-cloud
```

### Upgrade

```bash
brew upgrade datumforge/tap/datum-cloud
```

### Usage

```bash
datum-cloud
the datum-cloud cli

Usage:
  datum-cloud [command]

Available Commands:
  completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  help        Help about any command
  seed        the subcommands for creating demo data in datum
  workspace   the subcommands for working with the datum workspace
```

## Seeding Data

The `datum-cloud` cli has functionality to generate and load test data into `datum` using the `seed` command.

```bash
Usage:
  datum-cloud seed [command]

Available Commands:
  generate    generate random data for seeded environment
  init        init a new datum seeded environment
```

### Getting Started

Included in this repo is a [Taskfile](cmd/Taskfile.yaml) that makes the process quick. If you haven't used `task` before, head over to the upstream [docs](https://taskfile.dev/) to [install](https://taskfile.dev/installation/).

#### Prerequisites

1. Before running any of the cli commands you will need to install any dependencies
    ```bash
    task install
    ```

#### Using the Taskfile

On a brand new database, you should run:

1. Create a new user to authenticate with the Datum API, this command will fail on subsequent tries because the user will already exist.
    ```bash
    task register
    ```
1. Login as the user, create a new Personal Access Token that will be used to seed the data, generate a new data set, bulk load objects into the Datum API:
    ```bash
    task cli:seed:all
    ```

If instead, you prefer to use the CLI commands directly, keep reading.

### Generate Data

Using the `generate` subcommand, new random data will be stored in csv files:

```bash
datum-cloud seed generate
```

<details>
<summary>Generated Data</summary>

```bash
tree demodata
demodata
â”œâ”€â”€ groups.csv
â”œâ”€â”€ invites.csv
â”œâ”€â”€ orgs.csv
â””â”€â”€ users.csv
```

</details>

### Init Environment

Using the `init` subcommand, the data in the specified directory (defaults to `demodata` in the current directory), the csv files will be used to generate the data.

```bash
datum-cloud seed init
```

The newly created objects will be displayed when complete:
